# FilterSMS

This is simple SMS read application. Only different is it's filter the SMS using given keyword and reply to the sender preconfigured SMS.

## Setting up
1.	Need to create Realtime DB (Firebase) connection and add generated google-services.json to the app/src/ path.


## Pending Tasks
1.	currently DB has one record support. Need to modify as primary key based on receiver mobile number to filter
2.	currently on setting you can select siren tune, but it's not updating db. Need to enable that facility
3.	Setting/Siren Tune view list need to update from res/raw based on title names. (currently it just hardcoded list coming from string-array under values/setting.xml
4.	Need to add / remove siren tunes from the ListView


#### Enjoy the Free App and appreciate if you can suggest/work on the pending tasks
